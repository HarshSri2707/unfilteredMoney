      <p>When I see people celebrating their "lifetime free" credit cards, I cringe a little. Not because these cards are bad, but because most people don't realize what they're actually giving up.</p>
      
      <h2>The Three Hidden Costs</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Forex Markup: The Silent Killer</h3>
      <p>Most lifetime free cards charge 3.5% forex markup on international transactions. Premium cards charge 2%. On a ₹1 lakh international trip, that's ₹3,500 vs ₹2,000 - a difference of ₹1,500.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Reward Rate: Pennies vs Rupees</h3>
      <p>Lifetime free cards typically give 0.25-0.5% rewards. Premium cards with fees give 1.5-3.3%. On ₹5 lakh annual spend, that's ₹1,250 vs ₹7,500 - a difference of ₹6,250.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Opportunity Cost: What You Miss</h3>
      <p>No lounge access means ₹2,000 per visit out of pocket. No golf sessions. No hotel upgrades. These "soft benefits" add up to thousands annually.</p>
      
      <h2>The Math</h2>
      <p>Let's say you spend ₹50,000/month (₹6 lakh/year) and travel once internationally (₹1 lakh spend).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lost forex savings: ₹1,500</li>
        <li>Lost reward points: ₹6,000</li>
        <li>Lost lounge access: ₹4,000 (2 trips × 2 people)</li>
        <li><strong>Total opportunity cost: ₹11,500</strong></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>When Lifetime Free Makes Sense</h2>
      <p>Don't get me wrong - lifetime free cards are perfect for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginners building credit history</li>
        <li>Low spenders (under ₹20k/month)</li>
        <li>People who never travel</li>
        <li>Backup emergency cards</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>Calculate your own numbers. If you spend over ₹40k/month and travel occasionally, a premium card with a fee often pays for itself - and then some.</p>
